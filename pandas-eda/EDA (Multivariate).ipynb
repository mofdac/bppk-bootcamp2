    "Interpreting The Heatmap\n",
    "The first thing to note is that only the numeric features are compared as it is obvious that we cannot correlate between alphabets or strings. Before understanding the plot, let us see what exactly correlation is.\n",
    "\n",
    "**POSITIVE CORRELATION**: If an increase in feature A leads to increase in feature B, then they are positively correlated. A value 1 means perfect positive correlation.\n",
    "\n",
    "**NEGATIVE CORRELATION**: If an increase in feature A leads to decrease in feature B, then they are negatively correlated. A value -1 means perfect negative correlation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now lets say that two features are highly or perfectly correlated, so the increase in one leads to increase in the other. This means that both the features are containing highly similar information and there is very little or no variance in information. This is known as MultiColinearity as both of them contains almost the same information.\n",
    "\n",
    "So do you think we should use both of them as one of them is redundant. While making or training models, we should try to eliminate redundant features as it reduces training time and many such advantages.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now from the above heatmap,we can see that the features are not much correlated. The highest correlation is between SibSp and Parch i.e 0.41. So we can carry on with all features."

    "### Observations in a Nutshell for all features:\n",
    "**Sex**: The chance of survival for women is high as compared to men.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Pclass**:There is a visible trend that being a 1st class passenger gives you better chances of survival. The survival rate for Pclass3 is very low. For women, the chance of survival from Pclass1 is almost 1 and is high too for those from Pclass2. Money Wins!!!.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Age**: Children less than 5-10 years do have a high chance of survival. Passengers between age group 15 to 35 died a lot.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Embarked**: This is a very interesting feature. The chances of survival at C looks to be better than even though the majority of Pclass1 passengers got up at S. Passengers at Q were all from Pclass3.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Parch+SibSp**: Having 1-2 siblings,spouse on board or 1-3 Parents shows a greater chance of probablity rather than being alone or having a large family travelling with you."

    "In 3 dimensions, depth is added. Here, we can still manage to visualize our data - just imagine a room full of ping pong balls. But what happens when we move to 4 dimensions? It comes very hard for the human brain to imagine. Fortunately, in statistics, we have techniques that work with a large number of dimensions. These techniques can also be used to reduce the number of dimensions to something that works better on a human scale. In this course, we are going to be looking at these techniques.\n",

    "PCA lets you reduce the number of variables by finding new variables that combine the essence of several others. Finding such variables allows us to replace several  columns  in a table with just a few. In so doing, we will lose a little information, but we can make an informed choice by weighing up the benefit of simplifying the data against the downside of the lost information."
